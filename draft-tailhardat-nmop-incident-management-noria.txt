  Knowledge Graphs for Enhanced Cross-Operator Incident Management and
                             Network Design
         draft-tailhardat-nmop-incident-management-noria-latest

Abstract

   Operational efficiency in incident management on telecom and computer
   networks requires correlating and interpreting large volumes of
   heterogeneous technical information.  Knowledge graphs can provide a
   unified view of complex systems through shared vocabularies.  YANG
   data models enable describing network configurations and automating
   their deployment.  However, both approaches face challenges in
   vocabulary alignment and adoption, hindering knowledge capitalization
   and sharing on network designs and best practices.  To address this,
   the concept of a IT Service Management (ITSM) Knowledge Graph (KG) is
   introduced to leverage existing network infrastructure descriptions
   in YANG format and enable abstract reasoning on network behaviors.
   The key principle to achieve the construction of such ITSM-KG is to
   transform YANG representations of network infrastructures into an
   equivalent knowledge graph representation, and then embed it into a
   more extensive data model for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Risk
   Management applications.  An experiment is proposed to assess the
   potential of the ITSM-KG in improving network quality and designs.

1.  Introduction

   Incident management on telecom and computer networks, whether it is
   related to infrastructure or cybersecurity issues, requires the
   ability to simultaneously and quickly correlate and interpret a large
   number of heterogeneous technical information sources.  Knowledge
   graphs, by structuring heterogeneous data through shared
   vocabularies, enable providing a unified view of complex technical
   systems, their ecosystem, and the activities and operations related
   to them (see [I-D.marcas-nmop-knowledge-graph-yang] and
   [NORIA-O-2024]).  Using such formal knowledge representation allows
   for a simplified interpretation of networks and their behavior, both
   for NetOps & SecOps teams and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms
   (e.g. anomaly detection, root cause analysis, diagnostic aid,
   situation summarization), and paves the way, in line with the Network
   Digital Twin vision [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch], for
   the development of tools for detecting and analyzing complex network
   incident situations through explainable, actionable, and shareable
   models (see [FOLIO-2018], [SLKG-2023], and [GPL-2024]).

   However, despite potential benefits of using knowledge graphs, these
   are not mainstream yet in commercial network deployment systems and
   decision support systems (see [NORIA-UI-2024] for more on the
   decision support systems perspective).  YANG is a widely used
   standard among operators for describing network configurations and
   automating their deployment.  Using YANG representations in the form
   of a KG, as suggested in [I-D.marcas-nmop-knowledge-graph-yang],
   would minimize the effort required to adapt network management tools
   towards the unified vision and applications evoked above.  The lack
   of alignment between various YANG models on key concepts (e.g. for
   describing network topology) is, however, hindering this evolution
   [I-D.boucadair-nmop-rfc3535-20years-later].

   Furthermore, although [I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle]
   addresses the capitalization of incident management knowledge through
   a YANG model, it can be observed that the overall scope of YANG
   models does not naturally cover the description of the networks'
   ecosystem (e.g. physical equipment location, operator organization,
   supervision systems) or the description of network operations from an
   IT service management (ITSM) perspective (e.g. business processes and
   design rules used by the company, scheduled modification operations,
   remediation actions performed during incident handling).  As a
   consequence, the continuous improvement of network quality & designs
   requires additional data cross-referencing operations to properly
   contextualize incidents and learn from remediation actions taken
   (e.g. analyzing intervention technicians' verbatim, comparing actions
   performed on similar incidents but occurring on different networks).
   As a result of these additional efforts of contextualization, the
   capitalization of knowledge typically remains confined at the level
   of each network operator.  This, in turn, hinders the sharing of
   information within the community of researchers and system designers
   regarding failure modes and best practices to adopt, considering the
   concept of overall improvement of IT systems and the Internet.

   Realizing an ITSM knowledge graph for network deployment, anomaly
   detection and risk management applications has been studied for
   several years in the Semantic Web community (i.e. knowledge
   representation and automated reasoning leveraging Web technologies
   such as [RDF], [RDFS], [OWL], and [SKOS]).  Among other examples: the
   DevOpsInfra ontology [DevOpsInfra-2021] allows for describing sets of
   computing resources and how they are allocated for hosting services;
   the NORIA-O ontology [NORIA-O-2024] allows for describing a network
   infrastructure & ecosystem, its events, diagnosis and repair actions
   performed during incident management.  Assuming the continuous
   integration into a knowledge graph of data from ticketing systems,
   network monitoring solutions, and network configuration management
   databases, we remark that the resulting knowledge graph (Figure 1)
   implicitely holds the necessary information to (automatically) learn
   incident contexts (i.e. the network topology, its set of states and
   set of events prior to the incident) and remediation procedures (i.e.
   the set of actions and network configuration changes carried-out to
   resolve the incident).

    Figure 1: Learning an incident signature seen as a classification
    model that is trained on the relationship of the incident context
    (i.e. a subgraph centered around a Resource entity concerned by a
         given TroubleTicket) to the problem class defined at the
      TroubleTicket entity level.  Arrows are for object properties
       (owl:ObjectProperty), double line edges are for object class
                        relationships (rdf:type).

   By going a step further, we notice that a generic understanding of
   incident context can be extracted and shared among operators from
   knowledge graphs.  Indeed, a knowledge graph, being an instantiation
   of shared vocabularies (e.g.  RDFS/OWL ontologies and controlled
   vocabularies in SKOS syntax), sharing incident signatures can be done
   without revealing infrastructure details (e.g. hostname, IP address),
   but rather the abstract representation of the network (i.e. the class
   of the knowledge graph entities and relationships, such as "server"
   or "router", and or "IPoWDM link").

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  Firstly, the
   concept of an _ITSM-KG_ is introduced to leverage existing network
   infrastructure descriptions in YANG format and enable abstract
   reasoning on network behaviors.  Secondly, an experiment is proposed
   to assess the potential of the meta-knowledge graph in improving
   network quality and designs.  In addition to the main parts of the
   proposal, the document also covers data integration and data
   federation architectures in the Security Considerations section.
   This section specifically addresses the handling of event data
   streams and the provision of a unified view for different
   stakeholders.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  From YANG-based configurations to meta-knowledge graph

   In the following, we consider the use of Semantic Web technologies as
   the foundation for representing data in the form of a knowledge
   graph.  We also assume the ability to transform a description of
   configurations and network infrastructures expressed accordingly to a
   given (set of) YANG models into a knowledge graph representation.

   For the realization of this data transformation, we identify the
   following scenarios:

   YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-EQUIVALENCE:  The ontology structuring the target
      knowledge graph is an exact equivalence of the many YANG models
      organizing the configuration data.

   YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION:  The ontology structuring the target
      KG is a generalization of the YANG models organizing the
      configuration data.

   We note that the YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-EQUIVALENCE case requires a
   significant knowledge engineering effort to align all YANG models
   into a coherent ontology with a sufficient level of abstraction to
   enable the discovery and analysis of emergent behavioral models of
   networks independently of local configuration specifics.  However,
   this case has the advantage of being relatively easy to implement
   based on the available configuration data of an operator, for
   example, by implementing [RML] rules for constructing a knowledge
   graph from this data.

   For the YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION case, we observe that the
   transformation effort involves:

   1.  Being able to transform YANG models into their RDFS/OWL
       equivalent to provide a consistent interpretation of
       configuration data in a knowledge graph that aligns with each
       data source.

   2.  Being able to provide a generalized interpretation of these
       transformed YANG models by identifying alignments between key
       concepts in these models and those in a more expressive ontology.

   As an example, the YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION case could involve
   wanting to integrate Service and Network topology data, matching the
   Network Topologies [RFC8345] and Service Assurance [RFC9418] YANG
   data models, into a knowledge graph structured by the NORIA-O
   ontology [NORIA-O-2024].

   Although identifying alignments in the YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-
   GENERALIZATION case may appear non-trivial for "constructor" YANG
   models, it is worth noting that the design of YANG models generally
   relies on principles of concept hierarchies and reuse of common
   concepts between models to promote model interoperability, as is the
   case with the Abstract Network Model of [RFC8345].  Therefore, the
   task of identifying alignments can theoretically benefit from these
   design principles.

   In continuity of the above RFC8345 / NORIA-O example, providing an
   alignment may mean asserting a semantic equivalence between the RDFS/
   OWL representation of the "node" concept from [RFC8345] with the
   "noria:Resource" concept from [NORIA-O-2024].  Examples of approaches
   for linking ontologies are provided in Section 3.1.  As techniques
   for identifying alignments between data models is beyond the scope of
   this document, we refer interested readers to specialized literature
   in this field, such as [ONTO-MATCH-2022].

   TODO SecOps perspective

3.3.  Relation to the Digital Map

   Similar to the concept of _meta-knowledge graph_ (meta-KG) discussed
   in this document, the concept of _Digital Map_ discussed in
   [I-D.havel-nmop-digital-map-concept] emphasizes the need to structure
   heterogeneous data describing networks in order to simplify network
   management operations through unified access to this data.  The meta-
   knowledge graph extends the Digital Map concept by adding information
   about the lifecycle of infrastructures and services, as well as the
   context of their usage.  These additional pieces of information are
   considered essential for learning shareable activity models of
   systems.

   To clarify this positioning, the following lists (Section 3.3.1,
   Section 3.3.1.1, and Section 3.3.2) reflect the compliance of the
   meta-KG concept with the Digital Map Requirements defined in
   [I-D.havel-nmop-digital-map-concept].  A symbol to the right of each
   requirement name indicates the nature of compliance: *+* for
   compatibility, */* for partial satisfaction, *-* for non-compliance
   with the requirement.  A comment is provided as necessary.

3.3.1.  Core Requirements

   *+* REQ-BASIC-MODEL-SUPPORT:  nothing to report (n.t.r.)

   *+* REQ-LAYERED-MODEL:  n.t.r.

   */* REQ-PROG-OPEN-MODEL:  Partially satifying the requirement as the
      concept of meta-KG mainly relate to the knowledge representation
      topic rather than to the platform running the Digital Map service
      on top of the meta-knowledge graph.

   */* REQ-STD-API-BASED:  Same remark as for REQ-PROG-OPEN-MODEL.

   *+* REQ-COMMON-APP:  n.t.r.

   *+* REQ-SEMANTIC:  n.t.r.

   *+* REQ-LAYER-NAVIGATE:  n.t.r.

   *+* REQ-EXTENSIBLE:  Knowledge graphs implicitly satisfy this
      requirement, notably with OWL [OWL] and SKOS [SKOS] constructs if
      considering RDF knowledge graphs for the meta-KG (e.g. owl:sameAs
      to relate a meta-KG entity to some other entity of another
      knowledge graph, owl:equivalentClass to link concepts and
      properties used to interpret the meta-KG to concepts and
      properties from other data models, skos:inScheme to group new
      items of a controled-vocabulary as part of a skos:ConceptScheme).

   *+* REQ-PLUGG:  Same remark as for REQ-EXTENSIBLE.

   *+* REQ-GRAPH-TRAVERSAL:  This capability is naturally enabled as the
      meta-KG concept involves using a graph data structure.

3.3.1.1.  Design Requirements

   *-* REQ-TOPO-ONLY:  Requirement not satisfied as the meta-KG involves
      to have more than topological data to interpret and contextualize
      the network behavior.

   *-* REQ-PROPERTIES:  Same remark as for REQ-TOPO-ONLY.

   *-* REQ-RELATIONSHIPS:  Same remark as for REQ-TOPO-ONLY.

   *+* REQ-CONDITIONAL:  Native, notably considering the expressiveness
      of SPARQL [SPARQL11-QL] if using the Semantic Web protocol stack
      to run the meta-KG concept.

   *+* REQ-TEMPO-HISTO:  n.t.r.

3.3.2.  Architectural Requirements

   *+* REQ-DM-SCALES:  This capability applies as we can use data
      aggregation at the graph level (Figure 4 and Figure 5 compared to
      Figure 2 and Figure 3), aggregation without loss of information
      (Figure 4 and Figure 5), and load balancing (horizontal scaling)
      by partitioning the meta-KG (Figure 6).  Further, ease of
      integration is enabled thanks to existing standard graph data
      access protocols (e.g.  SPARQL Federated Queries [SPARQL11-FQ], as
      illustrated in Figure 6).

   */* REQ-DM-DISCOVERY:  Same remark as for REQ-PROG-OPEN-MODEL.

3.5.  Implementation status

   This section provides pointers to existing open source
   implementations of this draft or in close relation to it.

3.5.1.  NORIA

   The NORIA project aims at enabling advanced network anomaly detection
   using knowledge graphs.  Among the components resulting from this
   project, the following ones serve the use case described in this
   document:

   *  NORIA-O [NORIA-O-2024], is a data model for IT networks, events
      and operations information.  The ontology is developed using web
      technologies (e.g.  RDF, OWL, SKOS) and is intended as a structure
      for realizing an ITSM knowledge graph for Anomaly Detection (AD)
      and Risk Management applications.  Its use for anomaly detection
      is discussed in:

      -  [SLKG-2023] with a model-based design approach (i.e. query the
         graph to retrieve anomalies and their context) and a
         statistical learning approach (i.e. relate entities based on
         context similarities, then use this relatedness to alert and
         guide the repair).

      -  [GPL-2024] with a process mining approach to align a sequence
         of entities to activity models, then use this relatedness to
         guide the repair actions.

      -  [NORIA-UI-2024] a Web-based knowledge graph exploration design
         for incident management that combines the above [SLKG-2023] and
         [GPL-2024] techniques for broader coverage of anomaly cases and
         knowledge capitalization.

   *  A knowledge graph-based platform design [NORIA-DI-2023] using
      Semantic Web technologies and open source data integration tools
      to build an ITSM knowledge graph:

      -  SMASSIF-RML, a Semantic Web stream processing solution with
         declarative data mapping capability.

      -  ssb-consum-up, a Kafka to SPARQL gateway enabling end-to-end
         Semantic Web data flow architecture with a Semantic Service Bus
         (SSB) approach.

      -  grlc, a fork of CLARIAH/grlc with SPARQL UPDATE and GitLab
         interface features to facilitate the call and versioning of
         stored user queries in SPARQL syntax (e.g. for anomaly
         detection following the model-based design approach).

   *  SemNIDS [SemNIDS-2023], a test bench involving network trafic
      generation, open source Network Intrusion Detection Systems
      (NIDS), knowledge graphs, process mining and conformance checking
      components.

4.  Security Considerations

   As this document covers the _meta-knowledge graph_ concepts, and use
   cases, there is no specific security considerations.

   However, as the concept of a meta-knowledge graph involves the
   construction of a multi-faceted graph (i.e. including network
   topologies, operational data, and service and client data), it poses
   the risk of simplifying access to network operational data and
   functions that fall outside the knowledge graph users' responsibility
   or that could facilitate the intervention of malicious individuals.
   To support the discussion on mitigating this risk, we suggest
   referring to Figure 6, which illustrates the concept of partial
   access to the meta-knowledge graph based on rights associated with
   each user group (UG) at the data domain level.  We also recommend
   referring to [AMO-2012] for an example of implemention of access
   rights in a content management system that relies on Semantic Web
   models and technologies.  This implementation uses the AMO ontology,
   which includes a set of classes and properties for annotating
   resources that require access control, as well as a base of inference
   rules that model the access management strategy to carry out.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Acknowledgments

   We would like to thank Benoit Claise for spontaneously seeking to
   include the work of the NORIA research project in the vision of the
   NMOP working group through direct contact.

   We would also like to thank Fano Rampary for his initial analysis of
   the possibilities of defining a model conversion algebra for going
   from Yang data models to OWL ontologies.
